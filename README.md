# Codex tests

This repository contains exercises and utilities built by the Codex team, including a Java Swing HTTP client and a web-based Snake game.

## Run the projects with the menu
Use the interactive script to launch any of the available projects:
```bash
./run-project.sh
```
The menu lists the available options and launches each project with the required dependencies (Maven/JDK for `envio`, default browser for `snake`).
